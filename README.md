Hi, I’m Jason O'Grady 👋 

I love writing!

I've written for internal, external and developer audiences:
- 💻 Technical writing: Google Analytics DevSite, Google Optimize DevSite
- ⚡️ News and editorial: OG Blogger since '95 [https://www.powerpage.org]

When I'm not writing, I love to learn about:
- 🧠 AI, ML, & DL 
- 🧮 Data science
- 🔐 Cryptography

When I'm not learning, I love camping and photography. 

Some examples of my work:
- ✏️ Google Scholar [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p70VB-4AAAAJ]
- 🖼️ OGrady.ai [https://www.ogrady.ai/]
